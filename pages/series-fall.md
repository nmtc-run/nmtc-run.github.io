The Fall Series consists of nine short-distance races showcasing many of the area's most fun woodland singletrack trails. Races are held across the Twin Ports starting on Wednesday evenings and switching to Sunday afternoons as it gets darker earlier. The final race is followed by a potluck and prizes for all.

Entry is absolutely free. We welcome donations <a href="/donate">online</a> or at the race start.
