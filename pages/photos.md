We welcome professional photographers on our courses and tend to rely on volunteer photographers to cover our races. Photographers who volunteer their time to capture the entire field and make their photos available for free earn credit for the [Fennessey Award](/fennessey).

At every opportunity, we share photos on our Facebook pages. If you're looking for photos from a previous event, there's a good chance you can find them here:
