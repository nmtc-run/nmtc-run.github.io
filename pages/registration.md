## Refund policy

There are no refunds allowed for any reason including race cancellation.
The Race Director reserves the right to modify or cancel the race or course for safety concerns or natural disaster. In such cases there will be No Refunds of race entry fees. Each athlete must accept any such risk of their entry fee paid. There is no complimentary race entry to a future race.

Entry fees collected are used to develop and produce the event, starting well in advance of the race date – including course preparation, race supplies, permits and administration. We pledge to make every effort to produce a fair and safe event for all participants. Any decision we make that impacts the race date or potential cancellation is carefully considered and based on the overall event safety and manageability.

Entry fees are non-transferable between individuals or to future races.

## Entrance policy for transgender runners

We wish our events to be places where all runners are able to compete as who they are. We will accept each runner’s declared gender at face value and no additional supporting evidence is required. We have also introduced a third gender category, with place awards, for those who are a non-binary gender. 

## Finisher swag deadline

When you register via Ultrasignup, you may see a t-shirt size option. Because we must order finisher swag three weeks in advance of race day, we cannot guarantee finisher shirts for runners who wait to register until after we place the order. This policy aligns with NMTC's nonprofit mission to keep our expenses as low as possible in order to keep your entry fees as low as possible.
