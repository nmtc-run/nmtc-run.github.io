# Basic marking

Our primary course markers are hot orange pin flags with "NMTC" printed on them:  

* We plant a pin flag roughly every 0.1 mile (200 yards).
* We use this same interval for all trail types—singletrack, XC ski trail, paved runs, straight stretches, twisty trails, etc.

# Turn marking

We mark most turns with the hot orange pin flags:

* Leading into the turn, we plant three flags in succession (roughly 3 feet apart).
* Exiting the turn, we plant a single flag. Of course, when racing an out-and-back course such as the [Minnesota Voyageur](/voyageur), runners will see three pin flags on both the entrance and exit of the turn.
* We then resume normal spacing of 0.1 miles until the next turn.

Most turns feature pin flags—and only pin flags. However, in some situations, we will add one of the following arrow markers:

* Small black arrow on a white background.
* Large black arrow on an orange background.

# River crossings

We plant a pin flag on the opposite bank where runners should exit the water and continue on the race course.

# A few notes

We mark courses in order to make the route obvious even to a runner who has never traveled it before. Runners should still study the map and route before the race to assess the risks and take responsibility for their safety, as well as to stay on course during the race.

Trust your instincts when you encounter trail markers that don't seem quite right:

* Land managers and other trail users may use orange flagging or survey tape. Do not follow these off into the woods. NMTC courses stay on trail.
* Although extremely rare, sabotage or theft of trail markers has happened. And hey, maybe it was just somebody who thought they were doing everyone a favor by clearing the trail a little too early in the day. Regardless, if you see something, say something to aid station volunteers, so we can fix it and help everyone follow the racecourse.

Race directors will disqualify runners who fail to complete the entire course. Runners who leave the course (whether by accident or on purpose—for example, to relieve themselves) should return to the point where they left off and continue on course from there.
