  The Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon is run over rough woodland trails on a point-to-point course from the Lake Superior Zoo in Duluth, MN, to Carlton, MN.
  <br><br>
  The course encompasses one half of the Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultramarathon, plus a bit extra to reach 26.2 miles. NMTC introduced the race in 1992 as a thank you to Voyageur volunteers and an introduction to the course for those exploring the 50 miler. The race has become wildly popular in its own right.
  <br><br>
  Originally called the Half Voyageur Trail Marathon, in 2013 the race took the name of its indefatigable founder, the local trail and ultramarathon running legend <a href="/legends">Eugene Curnow</a>. Gene’s energy, enthusiasm, and volunteer spirit played a significant role in the success of the Minnesota Voyageur, the growth of the northern Minnesota running community, and the development of the sport of trail running in general.

# Getting to the start line

**Bus from finish area:**

When you park at the finish, your car is ready and waiting when you finish! Park near the Munger Trailhead at Magnum Trucking and Ponderosa Sales in Carlton, MN. Buses depart at 4:45 AM and arrive in plenty of time for check-in and bib pickup.

* **Finish Address:** 406 South Ave, Carlton, MN 55718
* **GPS:** [46.6620848, -92.4205273](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dtaecq7rvTo44A5V6) <img class="arrow-blank" src="/assets/icons/arrow-up-right-from-square.svg" alt="">

**Parking at start:**

Runners are encouraged to take advantage of the bus from the finish line. If you must leave your car at the start line, know that the Fairmont Park gravel parking lot can fill quickly. The lot is adjacent to the Lake Superior Zoo—please do \*not\* park in the Zoo lot. If you arrive too late to park in the gravel lot, plan to walk or jog to the start area from further afield. Runners are responsible for finding a way back to their vehicles after the race.
* **Start Address:** 7210 Fremont St, Duluth, MN 55807
* **GPS:** [46.7264351, -92.1902315](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D8NzRvwSxxSKiKqY7) <img class="arrow-blank" src="/assets/icons/arrow-up-right-from-square.svg" alt="">

# Race number pick-up and drop bag drop-off at start line

The time and place for bibs and bags is race morning in the start area. Runners take the bus from the finish line and arrive with plenty of time for number pick-up, bag drop-off, warm-up jogs, bathroom breaks, and the pre-race briefing.

* **Race number:** At the check-in desk, we will assign and present you with your race number.
* **Drop bags:**  Near the check-in desk, you will find a table with markers to label your bags with name and bib number. Look for signs directing you where to drop each bag.

# Runner support during the race

## Aid stations:
* Drinks include water, electrolyte drink, and various sodas.
* Food includes fruit, cookies, potato chips, and other sweet/salty options.
* We do \*not\* supply electrolyte supplement capsules, such as Endurolytes or S-Caps.
* We do \*not\* supply cups.
* Come prepared to meet your nutrition and hydration needs between aid stations. We strongly recommend you carry water during the race.

## Drop bags:

We heartily encourage runners to be self-sufficient and make use of our drop bag service.

* Note available drop bag locations on the [aid station](#aid-stations) chart.
* Please keep your drop bags reasonable in size.
* You must label drop bags with your name and race number. You will get your number at the check-in desk on race morning. If you want to prep your bags at home, duct tape and a Sharpie marker work well. We provide markers at check-in. Unmarked bags will not be delivered to the aid station.
* At the race start location, place your clearly marked bags by the signs for the aid station and the finish line, and we will deliver them to the appropriate place.
* We will return aid station drop bags to the finish line.

## Crew access:

Crew members are allowed to support their runners at designated [aid stations](#aid-stations).  

Some aid stations are designated \*no crew\*, which also means \*no spectators*\. We have to disqualify runners who ignore this rule. As a runner participant, you are responsible for your crew and fans understanding this limitation.

* **Hwy 210:** No crew, no spectators due to limited parking.
* **Peterson's:** No crew, no spectators due to limited parking.

Runners, please warn your crew and fans to drive with care. Reduce vehicle traffic around aid stations by carpooling and parking as far away as your legs allow. Reserve parking spots near aid stations for medical, resupply, and other race vehicles. Please pay special attention at the following aid stations:

* **Beck's Rd:** To prevent crowding, spectators can park on the road and spectate from the designated area at aid station or further down the trail towards the bridge.

# Details

**Trail markings:** Follow the hot orange pin flags with “NMTC” on them. If you don’t see one in about 0.1 miles, you are off course! Turns are marked with a series of pin flags a few feet apart on the side to which you’ll be turning—for example, a right-hand turn marked with three pin flags on the runner's right hand side. For more, see [course marking](/course-marking).

**Traffic warning:** Use care on bike paths and roads. Runners must yield to traffic when crossing roads! A race is just a run; a road crossing is life and death!  

**Footing warning:** The race is run primarily on rugged woodland singletrack with roots, rocks, and other potential hazards. Watch footing on the bridges; they can be slippery, especially when wet, and some may have boards missing.

**Cupless:** NMTC races are cup-free races. We will not provide paper cups at aid stations, and runners will need to carry their own cups (for example, collapsible cups, bottles, or other hydration vessels) for use at aid stations.

**Cutoffs:** Curnow aid stations enforce cutoffs (with the exception of the water-only Hwy 210 aid station, which is uncrewed). Please see the [aid station chart](#aid-stations) for specific cutoff times. Runners must reach the finish in 10 hours, by 4:00 PM.

**Results:** Results are posted on [Ultrasignup](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=101010){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [MTEC](https://www.mtecresults.com/race/leaderboard/15693){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

**Photos:** Photos are often uploaded to the [Curnow Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/minnesotavoyageur).

**Awards:** The top ten men, women, and nonbinary finishers receive a pottery mug; all finishers receive a medal.
