title: Trail Running Etiquette
permalink: /etiquette/

While we included these with an eye toward trail running, they aren’t bad practices for use on trails regardless of speed or means of locomotion.

Adapted from trailrunner.com with nods to Leave No Trace and IMBA.

1. **Don’t Litter.**
Pack out what you pack in.
Be mindful of “micro-trash” (tops of gel packets, small wrappers from energy bars or hard candy).
Consider carrying a small resealable bag to put your garbage in until you can find a trash receptacle.
2. **Stay on the Trail.**
Run in the middle of the trail, especially in wet conditions.
Running around the puddles/mud only widens the trail, causes further erosion and negatively impacts the surrounding vegetation.
If the trails are extremely wet consider running elsewhere until they dry out to minimize damage to the trail.
3. **Be Friendly / Don’t Startle other Trail Users.**
Let other trail users know you are approaching with a friendly “Trail” or “Runner on your left”.
Be ready to yield to other trail users. Uphill runners yield to downhill runners in most situations except in a race situation where slower runners yield to faster runners.
4. **Don’t Litter in a Race.**
The sweep is not your housekeeper. They are there to remove trail markings and act as a safety net for other runners, not to clean up garbage.
Consider carrying a water bottle or hydration pack to eliminate the need for cups (and the litter they cause).
Learn and use minimum impact methods of disposing of solid human waste. If you do need to stop, ensure that you are far enough off the trail that other trail users will not notice you.
5. **Give Back.**
Support local trail organizations.
Volunteer for trail maintenance projects.
Volunteer at a local trail race.
6. **Be Aware.**
Know what is going on around you, be on the lookout for other trail users.
Tune into the sounds and sights of the natural environment.
Some folks like music or podcasts while they run. Keep the volume low enough to stay aware, or even leave an earbud out of one ear.
Note that some races discourage earphones/buds for safety and insurance reasons. Please respect their requests.
7. **Remember to say “Thank You”.**
To the trail organization, race directors, volunteers, and other trail users who yield you the right of way.
8. **Don’t Litter Ever!**
Yeah, you’ve probably figured out by now that this one is a big deal…
Leave no trace. ’nuff said.
