# Our Mission

Founded in 1981, the Northern Minnesota Track Club (NMTC) is a non-profit, grassroots running club, promoting trail running and managing races in the Duluth / Superior area. Our mission is to provide trail-running events in which we can all participate in and have fun. Many of our races take place on challenging courses, which is part of the fun. Everyone is welcome to participate regardless of ability. Our trail runs are places where you can test and improve your fitness, enjoy the outdoors, and mingle with fellow runners.

# Our Committee

The NMTC is organized and managed by a committee of individuals who love the sport of trail running and are dedicated to its continued success and growth. This committee serves the NMTC, MN Voyageur Trail Ultramarathon, and Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon.
