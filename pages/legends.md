NMTC would be nothing without extraordinary [volunteers](/volunteer). Your commitments—large and small, whether in support of a single race or year after year—make it possible for NMTC to provide trail running events in which we can all participate in and enjoy.

Since our founding in 1981, several people have made outstanding contributions over the course of decades. They went above and beyond by dedicating a significant part of their lives to making more people feel included and enriched by this community.

We have not listed every single one here (at least, not yet—[contact](/contact) us with suggestions). For now, we dedicate these few pages to the many heroes who make our sport possible.
