The Spring Series consists of six short-distance races on a mix of surfaces—from creekside paths to gravel roads to sandy stretches along Lake Superior. Races are held across the Twin Ports—most on Wednesday evenings and one on a Sunday morning. The final race is followed by a potluck and prizes for all.

Entry is absolutely free. We welcome donations <a href="/donate">online</a> or at the race start.
