description: |- # retain newlines
  The Spring Series offers the trail community six short-distance races on a mix of surfaces—from creekside paths to gravel roads to sandy stretches along Lake Superior. Races are held across the Twin Ports—most on Wednesday evenings and one on a Sunday morning. The final race is followed by a potluck and prizes for all.

  Entry is absolutely free. We welcome donations <a href="/donate">online</a> and in-person (look for the tip jar at the registration table of each race). All funds support the continued viability of the NMTC Spring & Fall Race Series, the Eugene Curnow Marathon, and the Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultramarathon.

# Everyone is welcome 

All ages and abilities are welcome and well represented. The vibe is something akin to a neighborhood barbecue—a community event where old friends meet and new friends are made. Come join a bunch of folks who like to play in the woods!

# Fun events and competitive racing

We believe everyone can find exactly as much competition as they’re looking for. NMTC events offer a chance to test yourself against many of the area’s fastest trail runners or enjoy a fun run with friends—or both!—it’s entirely up to you.

We maintain overall series standings and award points to everyone based on the order they finish in each race. Find links to [race results and overall standings](#schedule-and-standings) above. We update the overall standings each week. You can find results from prior years on our [race results](/results) page.

Everyone who participates receives a prize—typically these are donated by local businesses. The emcee calls runners’ names in order of how they finished in the overall series, and each runner is invited to pick a prize when their name is called.

# Registration

Race registration is free. Donations are accepted [online](/donate) or at the race start.

Register at the starting line of each race. If you arrive about an hour before the race start, look for the person sitting at a folding table with a laptop. And if you arrive a little closer to race time, look for the line of people near the folding table and laptop!  

NMTC requires all runners to complete the waiver once per year. You are welcome to print your own and bring it to the race, or we will provide one at the race start.

# Refreshments

We supply water at the start/finish line of every race.

At the final race of each series, we hold a potluck. Bring a dish!
