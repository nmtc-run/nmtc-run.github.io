## Grassroots trail running events

NMTC presents trail races throughout the temperate seasons. Many folks plan their summers around our marathon and ultra: the Curnow and the Voyageur. And with our Spring and Fall Series, we host 15 shorter-distance races featuring free same-day registration. These regular gatherings of our local trail community have grown deep roots since 1981 and are known for their refreshingly chill vibe as well as highly competitive racing.

Runners and volunteers who show up to every single event in a calendar year earn the [Ella Fennessey Award](/fennessey-award) and join the ranks of the most dedicated local trail running enthusiasts.
