## Note: 

* Results are maintained by NMTC volunteers. You can help by [contacting us](/contact) when you see missing or innacurate data—especially runner age data. 

* We calculate the number of finishes a runner has achieved by counting the number of times a first+last name appears in the historical results. The number of finishes will be incorrect if there's a typo, name change, two runners with the same name, etc. 

* Currently, 57 runners who finished Voyageur between 1982 and 1987 have missing age data. The same goes for nearly 600 runners who finished Curnow between 1992 and 2016. Regrettably, this puts an asterisk on the age-category course records. 

* And that's all we have to say about that (to borrow the words of ultrarunner Forrest Gump). Folks are welcome to [debate](https://www.facebook.com/minnesotavoyageur/){:target="_blank"} which historical editions were "faster" due to differences in the course, the weather, the alignment of the planets, etc. Please enjoy.
