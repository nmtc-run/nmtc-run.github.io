## YOU make Voyageur and Curnow possible

Well-marked courses. Well-stocked aid stations. A safe, fun, and exciting atmosphere. This stuff just doesn't happen without volunteers!

Although we often pretend the course makes the race, it's the people—competitors, supporters, and volunteers—who create the experience and make the memories.

We rely on all our volunteers to provide a successful event:

* When you volunteer at either the [Curnow Marathon](/curnow) or the [Voyageur 50](/voyageur), we give you a discounted entry to the other race.

* If you're volunteering as part of your job, education, or race requirement, we're happy to complete any necessary paperwork to verify your time commitment.

* When you participate in every NMTC event in a calendar year—whether by running or volunteering—you qualify for the coveted [Ella Fennessey Award](/fennessey-award).

Time commitments vary and many important tasks are appropriate for all ages. That makes volunteering a great way to introduce friends and family to the world of trail running. We promise you will have an absolute blast supporting racers, meeting new people, and giving back to the trail running community. That's a guarantee—or your money back!

Opportunities include:

* **Aid station volunteers:** This is our highest-priority—far and away our biggest need each year. Fortunately, it’s also one of the most fun things to do on race day. Assemble a group of friends for the day, or just bring yourself and make some great new friends—all while providing the most essential contribution to race day success for our runners!

* **Road crossings and road monitoring:** Several aid stations feature this safety role—a responsibility that requires the highest level of commitment and focus. This is generally handled in shifts. We only have a couple of crossings, but their busy nature makes this extremely important.

* **Medical & first aid specialists:** A level of medical training is preferred – e.g. doctor, nurse, EMT, formal first-aid training, or similar.

* **Aid station captains:** Captains tend to be experienced volunteers who oversee setup/takedown, track food/drink inventories, communicate with race organizers and HAM radio operators, and generally empower the team to take great care of runners.

* **Drop bag delivery and aid station resupply**: Volunteers drive their own vehicles. Some bring drop bags from the start to aid stations and the finish. Others deliver extra food, water, ice, and other supplies to keep aid stations running smoothly.

* **Course marking, checking, and sweeping:** These volunteers have experience running and racing on the Curnow/Voyageur course. Before the race, markers plant flags and arrows. Race morning, checkers make sure the marking is easy to follow. After the race, sweepers clear the course of all marking.

* **Friday race prep and Sunday cleanup:** These are absolutely essential and often overlooked parts of the race—and a fantastic option for everyone who wants to both support the race and race the race. On Friday, volunteers stage aid station equipment and supplies. On Sunday, we wash water jugs, food containers, and reorganize equipment for the next race.

* **Other roles:** Click into the sign-up form above for a complete list of ways to help before, during, and after the race.

# Spring & Fall Series

When you volunteer for Spring and Fall Series races, you earn points toward the overall standings and stay eligible for the Ella Fennessey Award. Whenever you're not running, just [contact us](/contact) in advance or show up between 5:30 and 6:00 pm on race day. We’ll find a job for everyone!  

# Volunteering FAQ

## What happens if I claim the discount but don't volunteer?

Volunteering in exchange for discounted race entry is a very nice benefit, indeed! But please don't sign up to volunteer just for the discount and back out later—it leaves us short-handed on race day. We do audit attendance post-race and contact no-shows to square up.

## What if my circumstances change, and I can't follow through on my commitment?

If for some reason your ability to volunteer changes, please notify us right away. We rely on all of our volunteers to help us provide a successful event.

## Other questions?
