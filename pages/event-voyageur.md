  Founded in 1982, the Minnesota Voyageur 50 Mile Trail Ultramarathon is one of the oldest trail ultras in the nation. The race follows a rugged, varied, out-and-back course that takes runners on a journey from Carlton, MN, through Jay Cooke State Park, and heads northeast over difficult, rough woodland trails to Duluth, MN—and back. Enjoy scenic overlooks of Lake Superior and cross the iconic Swinging Bridge over the dalles of the St. Louis River. </br></br>Carlton High School hosts the start, finish, and race-day festivities. Weather for the Minnesota Voyageur can be extreme. There have been several years when it was hot and humid—including 2003 when it was brutally hot with 90 percent humidity. In other years it has been cool, in the mid-50’s, and wet. Plan for everything except snow—at least not so far!

# Runner support

## Aid station items:
* Drinks include water, electrolyte drink, and various sodas.
* Food includes fruit, cookies, potato chips, and other sweet/salty options.
* We do \*not\* supply electrolyte supplement capsules, such as Endurolytes or S-Caps.
* We do \*not\* supply cups. We strongly recommend you carry water during the race in a bottle or other hydration system.

## Crew access:

**<span class="nb">¡ ATTENTION !</span>** Runners’ crews and spectators are \*not\* allowed at Hwy 210 or Peterson’s aid stations due to limited parking. We have to disqualify runners who ignore this rule. As a runner participant, you are responsible for your crew and fans understanding this limitation.

To prevent crowding at Becks Rd aid station, spectators can park on the road and spectate from the designated area at aid station or further down the trail towards the bridge.

## Drop bags:

* Note available drop bag locations on the [aid station](#aid-stations-crew-access-and-drop-bags) chart.
* Please keep your drop bags reasonable in size.
* You must label drop bags with your name and race number. Do this at home so you don’t have to worry about it on race morning. Duct tape and a Sharpie marker work well. Unmarked bags will not be delivered to the aid station.
* At the race start location, place your clearly marked bags by the signs for each aid station, and we will deliver them to those aid stations.
* We will return your drop bags to the finish.

# Getting to the start

**Address:** Carlton High School 405 School Ave, Carlton, MN 55718

**GPS:** [46.6651196,-92.4226923](https://goo.gl/maps/9W3JPx3k8jA2) <img class="arrow-blank" src="/assets/icons/arrow-up-right-from-square.svg" alt="">

**Parking at start/finish:** A good amount of parking is available in the lots behind and near the school. Some parking is also available on the streets surrounding the school.

**<span class="nb">¡ USE CAUTION !</span>** Approaching the start/finish area on Walnut Ave intersects with 4th St, which is the final sprint to the finish line for our runners. If you can, please use a different route to School Ave, such as 5th or 6th St.

# Details

**Trail markings:** Follow the hot orange pin flags with “NMTC” on them. If you don’t see one in about 0.1 miles, you are off course! Turns are marked with a series of pin flags a few feet apart on the side to which you’ll be turning—for example, a right-hand turn marked with three pin flags on the runner's right hand side. For more, see [course marking](/course-marking).

**Traffic warning:** Use care on bike paths and roads. Runners must yield to traffic when crossing roads! A race is just a run; a road crossing is life and death!  

**Footing warning:** The race is run primarily on rugged woodland singletrack with roots, rocks, and other potential hazards. Watch footing on the bridges; they can be slippery, especially when wet, and some may have boards missing.

**Cupless:** NMTC races are cup-free races. We will not provide paper cups at aid stations, and runners will need to carry their own cups (for example, collapsible cups, bottles, or other hydration vessels) for use at aid stations.

**Cutoffs:** Voyageur aid stations enforce cutoffs (with the exception of the water-only Hwy 210 aid station, which is uncrewed). Please see the [aid station chart](#aid-stations-crew-access-and-drop-bags) for specific cutoff times. Runners must reach the finish in 14 hours, by 8:00 PM.

**Results:** Results are posted on [Ultrasignup](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=114070){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [MTEC](https://www.mtecresults.com/event/show/4974/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

**Photos:** Photos are often uploaded to the [Voyageur Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/minnesotavoyageur).

**Awards:** Top 10 men and women receive a pottery mug; all finishers receive a medal.

**Area events:** Coinciding with Voyageur race weekend, the city of Carlton, MN will be putting on their annual [Carlton Daze](https://carltonchamber.com/carlton-daze/) festivities, including a 5k Run/Walk, kids fun races, a spaghetti feed, and much more. Organizers really appreciate support on Friday evening, when volunteer help is always appreciated.
