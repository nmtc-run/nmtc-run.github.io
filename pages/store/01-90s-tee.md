## Back in the 1990s, you'd have seen <a href="/legends">NMTC legends</a> like Eugene Curnow and Ella Fennessey sporting a shirt like this. Now, you can bring back the legendary look.

**<span class="nb">¡ NOTE !</span>** These particular t-shirts are known to run small, so we urge you to order a size up.

Product details:
* 100% organic ring-spun cotton
* Fabric weight: 5.3 oz/yd² (180 g/m²)
* Made in China or Bangladesh

__Q. Your races are affordable! Why is this so spendy?__<br>
__A.__ Your support helps keep race fees low! About 40 percent of the purchase price goes to NMTC, and the rest goes to the manufacturer. Of course, if you want 100 percent of your dollars to support local trail racing, you can always [make a donation](/donate).

__Q. When will my stuff arrive?__<br>
__A.__ Plan to wait a week longer than usual. Printful.com makes your item when you place your order. This saves NMTC the time and expense of handling inventory, packaging, and shipping, so we can focus on organizing races.
