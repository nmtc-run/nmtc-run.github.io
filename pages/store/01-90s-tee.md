## Back in the 1990s, you'd have seen <a href="/legends">NMTC legends</a> like Eugene Curnow and Ella Fennessey sporting a shirt like this. Now, you can bring back the legendary look.

Roughly 40 percent of your purchase goes to NMTC. If you want 100 percent of your cash to support local trail racing, you can always make a [donation](/donate).

It takes a bit longer than normal to deliver your shirt because the manufacturer prints it when you place your order. This saves NMTC the time and expense of handling inventory, packaging, and shipping, so we can focus on organizing races.

Product details:
* 100% organic ring-spun cotton
* Fabric weight: 5.3 oz/yd² (180 g/m²)
* Made in China or Bangladesh

**<span class="nb">¡ NOTE !</span>** These particular t-shirts are known to run small, so we urge you to order a size up.
