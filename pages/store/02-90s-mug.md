## An NMTC trophy to lift before every run—or to relax with after a long one.

Roughly 40 percent of your purchase goes to NMTC. If you want 100 percent of your cash to support local trail racing, you can always make a [donation](/donate).

It takes a bit longer than normal to deliver your mug because the manufacturer prints it when you place your order. This saves NMTC the time and expense of handling inventory, packaging, and shipping, so we can focus on organizing races.

Product details:
* Ceramic
* 11 oz mug dimensions: 3.85″ height, 3.35″ diameter
* Dishwasher and microwave safe
* Made in China
