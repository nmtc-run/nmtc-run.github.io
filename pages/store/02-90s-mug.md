__Q. Your races are affordable! Why is this so spendy?__<br>
__A.__ Your support helps keep race fees low! About 40 percent of the purchase price goes to NMTC. The rest goes to the manufacturer. Of course, if you want 100 percent of your dollars to support local trail racing, you can always [make a donation](/donate).

__Q. When will my stuff arrive?__<br>
__A.__ Plan to wait a week longer than usual. Printful.com makes your item when you place your order. This saves NMTC the time and expense of handling inventory, packaging, and shipping, so we can focus on organizing races.
