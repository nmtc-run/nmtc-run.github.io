Spread the good word of great local trail running, with these NMTC-branded, lifestyle-enhancing conversation starters. When people do a double take and ask you "What's that NMTC thing?" and "Can I get into that, too?" be sure to tell them:

* __NMTC supports the Twin Points trail running community.__ Runners of all ages and abilities can enjoy 15 completely free and absolutely fun Spring and Fall Series events.

* __NMTC carries forward an American trail running legacy.__ The Minnesota Voyageur 50mi is one of longest-running trail ultras in the United States.

* __NMTC makes trail running events accessible to more people.__ We keep race fees lowâ€”and drive them even lower for [volunteers](/volunteer).

Why is this stuff so expensive? About 40 percent of the purchase price goes to NMTC, and the rest goes to the manufacturer. Of course, if you want 100 percent of your dollars to support local trail racing, you can always [make a donation](/donate).
