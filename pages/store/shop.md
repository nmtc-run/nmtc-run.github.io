Spread the good word of great local trail running, with these NMTC-branded, lifestyle-enhancing conversation starters. When people do a double take and ask you "What's that NMTC thing?" and "Can I get into that, too?" be sure to tell 'em:

* __Jump into \*free\* short-distance Spring/Fall Series races.__ NMTC supports local trail running with 15 completely free, absolutely fun—and highly competitive—races.

* __Experience an American trail running legacy.__ The Voyageur 50mi is one of longest-running trail ultras in the U.S.A.—and the Curnow Marathon runs on the same trails.

* __Everyone is welcome.__  NMTC makes trail running events more accessible by keeping race fees low—and driving them even lower for [volunteers](/volunteer).
