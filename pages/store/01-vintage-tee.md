This classic organic cotton tee features a modern take on the vintage shirt modeled by the likes of [NMTC legends](/curnow), Eugene and Barb Curnow.

• 100% organic ring-spun cotton
• Fabric weight: 5.3 oz/yd² (180 g/m²)
• Single jersey
• Made in China or Bangladesh

Roughly 38 percent of your purchase goes to NMTC, supporting the Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon, the Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultra, and the free Spring & Fall Series. If you want 100 percent of your cash to support local trail racing, please make a donation at nmtc.run/donate.

NOTE: These shirts are known to run small, so you should probably order a size up.

It takes a bit longer than normal to deliver your shirt because the manufacturer prints it when you place your order. This saves NMTC the time and expense of handling inventory, packaging, and shipping, so we can focus on organizing races.
