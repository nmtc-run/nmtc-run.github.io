# Fun events and competitive racing

**Run your race**: We believe everyone can find exactly as much competition as they’re looking for. NMTC events offer a chance to test yourself against many of the area’s fastest trail runners or enjoy a fun run with friends—or both!—it’s entirely up to you.

**Overall series standings:** Runners are awarded points based on the order in which they finish. To see historical results, click on the race name, then click on the year. We update overall standings after each race.

**Series finale potluck and prizes:** At the final race, join us for awards and a potluck {{ potluck }}. Bring a dish! Everyone who runs or volunteers at any Series race receives a prize. Prizes are generously donated by individuals and local businesses.

**Everyone is welcome:** All ages and experience levels are welcome and well represented at our running events. The vibe is something akin to a neighborhood barbecue—a community gathering to meet old friends and make new ones. Come join a bunch of folks who like to play in the woods!

# Registration

Races are free. We do have a donation jar at each race and an [online donation option](/donate), with all contributions dedicated directly toward the continued viability of the NMTC race series, the Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon, and the Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultramarathon.

Check in at the starting line of each race. If you arrive about an hour before the race start, look for the person sitting at a folding table with a laptop. And if you arrive a little closer to race time, look for the line of people near the folding table and laptop!  

NMTC requires all runners to complete a waiver once per year. Waiver forms are provided at the check-in table at all races—or you can download, print, and sign the waiver in advance:

# Details

**Trail markings:** Follow the hot orange pin flags with “NMTC” on them. If you don’t see one after 0.1 miles or so, you are off course! Turns are marked with a series of pin flags a few feet apart on the side to which you’ll be turning—for example, a right-hand turn marked with three pin flags on the runner's right hand side. For more, see [course marking](/course-marking).

**Runner safety:** Unlike the [Curnow Marathon](/curnow) and [Voyageur 50](/voyageur), {{ springFall }} Series races have \*zero\* road crossings. As always, many of our race courses feature rugged woodland singletrack with roots, rocks, and other potential hazards. Watch footing on the bridges; they can be slippery, especially when wet, and some may have boards missing.

**Rainout/cancellation policy:** Check the [NMTC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/runnmtc/){:target="_blank"} for the latest information. If we cancel a race, we announce the cancellation on Facebook by noon on race day. 

**Cupless:** NMTC races are cup-free races. We supply water at the start/finish line of every race, but you must bring your own cup.

**Photos:** Photos are often uploaded to the [NMTC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/runnmtc).

# Volunteer opportunities

Not running? Volunteer instead! You'll earn points toward the {{ springFall }} Series overall standings and stay eligible for the [Ella Fennessey Award](/fennessey-award).

If you're interested in volunteering, [contact us](/contact) in advance or show up between 5:30 and 6:00 pm on race day. We'll find a job for everyone!
