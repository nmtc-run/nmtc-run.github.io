# Everyone is welcome

All ages and experience levels are welcome and well represented at our running events. The vibe is something akin to a neighborhood barbecue—a community gathering to meet old friends and make new ones. Come join a bunch of folks who like to play in the woods!

# Fun events and competitive racing

We believe everyone can find exactly as much competition as they’re looking for. NMTC events offer a chance to test yourself against many of the area’s fastest trail runners or enjoy a fun run with friends—or both!—it’s entirely up to you.

We maintain overall series standings and award points to everyone based on the order they finish in each race. Find links to [race results and overall standings](#overall-standings) above. We update the overall standings each week. You can find results from prior years on our [race results](/results) page.

Everyone who runs or volunteers receives a prize at our end-of-series potluck. Prizes are donated by individuals and local businesses.

# Registration

Races are free. We do have a donation jar at each race and an [online donation option](/donate), with all contributions dedicated directly toward the continued viability of the NMTC race series, the Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon, and the Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultramarathon.

Register at the starting line of each race. If you arrive about an hour before the race start, look for the person sitting at a folding table with a laptop. And if you arrive a little closer to race time, look for the line of people near the folding table and laptop!  

NMTC requires all runners to complete a waiver once per year. Waiver forms are provided at the check-in table at all races. 

# Refreshments

We supply water at the start/finish line of every race, but you must bring your own cup.

At the final race, join us for awards and a potluck {{ potluck }}. Bring a dish!

# Volunteer opportunities

Not running? Volunteer instead! You'll earn points toward the {{ springFall }} Series overall standings and stay eligible for the [Ella Fennessey Award](/fennessey-award).

If you're interested in volunteering, [contact us](/contact) in advance or show up between 5:30 and 6:00 pm on race day. We'll find a job for everyone!
