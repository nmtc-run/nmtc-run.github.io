  description: Point Pine (Neyaashi) is a lollipop course with a long out-and-back section that passes through Pine Point Scientific Natural Area, a remnant of old-growth coastal red and white pine forest. The route offers beautiful views of the outer St. Louis River estuary and Lake Superior. The trail is mostly flat and well drained with a mix of packed gravel, packed earth and short sections with loose sand. The outermost loop portion of the course passes by the brick ruins of the Minnesota Point Light, a navigational aid constructed in 1858. It is the oldest brick structure in Duluth. This is a fast, non-technical course but get ready for some sand in your shoes.

  description: Spirit Mountain 10 Mile (Manidoo Wajiw) is an out-and-back road run that largely follows the western most section of Skyline Parkway from beneath the upper Spirit Mountain Chalet to Becks Road. The parkway surface is mostly gravel but also has short sections of new and crumbling asphalt. The near middle of the route offers a sweeping view of the St. Louis River estuary and Morgan Park neighborhood from the Bardon’s Peak overlook. This is also the course’s subtle high point. Make sure to save energy for the gradual ascent back to here from the Becks Road turnaround! The parkway is open to vehicle traffic this time of year. Please be mindful on blind turns.
